# Contributing

Any help is appreciated.
Bugs, suggestions - [create an issue](https://github.com/di72nn/wallabag-api-wrapper/issues/new) (if there isn't already).


## Contributing code

Follow existing code style (default-ish IDEA's style), keep code readable and understandable.
Prefer separate PRs for distinct features. Prefer multiple commits for unrelated changes.
